## Overview

This is a pretty simple Flappy Bird clone made in JavaScript that only has the most basic collison detection. This is based on the tutorial by Mammoth Interactive, but I added comments so that I can come back to this and make updates later. 

Planned improvements include:
 - Separating html, js and css
 - Random generation of obstacles
 - Increasing difficulty as the game goes on
 - Scoring system & scoreboard

### The idea

- Flappy Bird Clone
  - Draw the canvas, obstacles and player
  - Control the player by pressing the W and S keys
  - Generate obstacles and have them move across the screen
  - Detect when the player collides with an obstacle and reload the game

## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- HTML 5
- JSitor

### What I learned

Many thanks to Mammoth Interactive for their tutorial for this process. This was a good, simple tutorial for introducing the HTML 5 canvas and learning some of its basic functionality. The tutorial uses an array of randomly generated rectangle obstacles and updates their position at a set interval. Once they reach the end, they respawn on the other side of the canvas.

### Continued development

- January 20, 2023
  - I finished the tutorial.  
  - Added comments to my code to make it easy to come back
  - Added screenshot, and active link to deployment
- February 13, 2023
  - Created plans for future updates
- April 3, 2023
  - Split apart JS from HTML
  - Changed file name to index for direct link to project
  - added Title, meta tags for mobile support and Bootstrap5 link code
